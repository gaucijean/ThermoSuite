# ThermoSuite
ThermoSuite offers a set of tools with the ability of analyzing dynamic thermal video data.

Methods used and results obtained are presented in [1]. 

Video data in the Videos folder is related to the results presented in [1]. Dynamic thermal data from human participants left and right feet as well as dynamic thermal data from a static object was captured.  Specifically, dynamic thermal data recording of a leather ball, with emissivity = 0.95, was obtained.  

The aim with the capture of the data on the leather ball was to simulate the recording of the data from human feet on an object whose temperature variations are known. More information regarding the acquisition protocol and the methods of analysis are available in the manuscript. 

The data was analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine and identify different processes which affect the overall temperature variations observed through thermal imaging. The first three computed components from the leather ball as well as the human feet are available in Figure 1 and Figure 2 in Figures folder respectively as well as the manuscript. 

The videos of the reconstructed data explain the reconstructuions as follows: 

Video 1 - Original video for dynamic thermal acquisition of static leather ball.
Video 2 - Reconstruction of data without component describing change in background temperature.
Video 3 - Reconstruction of data without component describing process of warming of ball surface representative of physiological process. 
Video 4 - Reconstruction of first principal component only.
Video 5 - Reconstruction of second principal component only.
Video 6 - Reconstruction of third principal component only.

Video 7 - Original video for dynamic thermal acquisition of human participant.
Video 8 - Reconstruction of data without component describing change in background temperature.
Video 9 - Reconstruction of data without component describing physiological process.
Video 10 - Reconstruction of first principal component only.
Video 11 - Reconstruction of second principal component only.
Video 12 - Reconstruction of third principal component only.
